# Hi, my name is Guillermo Suárez

### I am a Game Programmer specialized in Unreal Engine and Unity.

I studied Game Programming master at U-TAD university, on Madrid, and in turn I development together with 15 other teammates a TFM called Howl of Iron, a game in third person of combat genre.

In the past, I worked in other game how as TFG called BattleRooms, made with Unity, https://github.com/SokerOne/Battle-Rooms.

In addition, in the master I have worked in programming languages such as C++, C#, LUA along with game engines like Unity, Unreal Engine 4.

I joined in two game jams: Subject15 (Unreal Engine, https://github.com/SokerOne/Subject15) and Prision del coso (Unity, https://github.com/SokerOne/PrisonEscape_JAM).

And finally, my last TFM project called Howl Of Iron. It is the biggest project I have ever been involved in (17 people in total and 9 months to finish it). It's a third person combat action game. We have it on the Steam platform https://store.steampowered.com/app/2235790/Howl_of_Iron/ right now. But if you are interested in seeing what we have done inside I have no problem to show you what you want in a video call, as the game repository is private and I can't attach a link here so you can see it freely.

Now, in 2023, I am open to work and grow up how as proffesional in the game industry.
